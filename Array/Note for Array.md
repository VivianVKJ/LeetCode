**26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array I**

exceptional case：if( nums.empty() ) return 0;  
>use two pointers: `slow` and `fast`. 
if `nums[slow]`==`nums[fast]`，pointer `fast` increas 1;
if`nums[slow]`!=`nums[fast]`, they both increase one.  return slow+1

***
**80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II**
>use two pointers as well  
use a `count` variable to keep how many times the duplicated element appears.  
count is initialized to be 0;  the first time `nums[slow]`==`nums[fast]` both pointers and `count` increase 1; and jump other cases when `count`==1;
